# XNL-21BBS0226-LLM-2
Fintech LLM Fine-Tuning &amp; Optimization in collaboration with XNL-Innovation
Project Overview

This project involves fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) on a fintech dataset to enhance its understanding of financial queries, transactions, and support tickets. The workflow is structured into three major phases:

-Data Preparation & Preprocessing
-Model Fine-Tuning
-Optimization & Benchmarking

The goal is to optimize the model for latency, efficiency, and accuracy while maintaining high performance for fintech applications.

PART 1: DATA PREPARATION & PREPROCESSING

1️) Collect & Curate a Fintech Dataset

Simulated financial queries, transaction descriptions, and support tickets.

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Pandas, NLTK, and NumPy.

Split the dataset into train, validation, and test sets.

2️) Develop a Data Pipeline

Implemented a script to automate data preprocessing.

Tokenized text and normalized financial terms.

Documented data statistics and sample records.

PART 2: MODEL FINE-TUNING SETUP

1️) Environment Setup

Configured Python environment using:

PyTorch / TensorFlow

Hugging Face Transformers

Datasets and Tokenizers libraries

2️) Fine-Tuning Process

Loaded a pretrained LLM (e.g., OPT, LLaMA, GPT) for training.

Implemented prompt engineering strategies.

Tuned hyperparameters such as:

Learning Rate, Batch Size, Epochs

Validation metrics: Perplexity, Accuracy, F1 Score

3️) Experiment Logging

Integrated TensorBoard for experiment tracking.

Saved model checkpoints & hyperparameter configurations.

PART 3: OPTIMIZATION & BENCHMARKING

1️) Measure Latency & Throughput

Benchmarked inference latency & throughput using the test dataset.

Recorded response times, memory usage, and FLOPs.

2️) Optimize Model Inference

Applied Model Quantization and Optimized Batching for speedup.

Used Distillation Techniques to reduce model size.

Re-benchmarked performance after each optimization step.

3️) Evaluate Accuracy & Efficiency

Conducted extensive evaluation to balance latency, efficiency, and accuracy.

Compared optimized models against baseline performance.
